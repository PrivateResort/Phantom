                    <p>Former Member#4 of Phantom Troupe</p>
                    <p>As for Hisoka's desire to fight the leader of the Phantom Troupe, Chrollo Lucilfer, it stems from
                        his fascination with Chrollo's abilities and intellect. Chrollo is widely regarded as one of the
                        most formidable characters in the series, possessing a unique skill set known as "Skill Hunter."
                        This ability allows Chrollo to steal and utilize other people's abilities, making him an
                        incredibly versatile and dangerous opponent.</p>
                    <p>Hisoka's desire to fight Chrollo can be seen as a manifestation of his obsession with strong
                        opponents. Chrollo represents the pinnacle of strength and skill in Hisoka's eyes, and defeating
                        him would be the ultimate test of his own abilities. Hisoka is drawn to the challenge that
                        Chrollo presents and sees their potential battle as the ultimate climax to his personal journey.
